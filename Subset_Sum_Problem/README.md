# Subset_Sum_Problem
This is a problem based on Dynamic Programming.
Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum.

Methodology :
I have created a list of the set of non-negative integers.
Created a func SumSetVariables(List<int> set, int sum) with return type List<int>, return the values equal to the sum.
Created a func Add(int x,int y) to add two numbers and returm the sum:int.
